#Interactivity of the web

The web was starting to become interactive. In 2001, Crampton Smith helped found the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, a small institute in Northern Italy dedicated solely to interaction design. Two popular browsers between 2000 and 2004 were Opera and NetScape. JavaScript was used with NetScape to provide some interactivity to the web. Opera was also popular, but in 2000 Internet Explorer 5.0 for Macintosh launched, becoming the first browser to have full CSS1 support; it surpassed Opera, which had been the leader since its introduction of CSS 1 support 15 month earlier. In 2004, Google made a wide deployment of standards-compliant, cross browser Ajax with Gmail. Also, in October of 2004 Kayak.com’s public beta release was among the first large-scale e-commerce uses of what their developers at that time called "the xml http thing". The book Thoughtful interaction design: A design perspective on information technology by Erik Stolterman (MIT Press, 2004) introduces a number of concepts for thinking about interaction design processes, skills and practices.<br>

#My usage of the web
I wasn’t using the web by 2000, but I was definitely using it by 2004. I think the web started becoming increasingly popular during this period. I shared a desktop mac computer with my brother. I used it mostly for playing games online and researching information for different school projects. I was too young to have social media at that point; I was only in 4th grade. I wish I could remember more exact details but something that I do know is very different is that I didn’t depend on the web as much as I do know. It was just a fun addition to our daily lives and not a necessity like it is now. <br>
