		<p> Week 1 (Aesthetics of the Internet): </p>
		<p> In “Aesthetics of the Internet”, Joichi Ito argues that context equates to the interconnectedness of computer and people that the Internet provides. I think it is a very interesting argument, rather placing the worth or the value on the Internet or its users, its the interaction that seems to interest him. I also agree with such statement because even if the information is available and there are people that are educated, passionate, and actively engaged without the mesh of them together, no thought or action can be produced. With large amount of information being accessed and shared, communities continue to excel and grow. But at the same, the type of information shared could also be quite limiting. Since the Internet is still managed by people, the dominance of some ideas over others is inevitable. In most cases, the Internet is open source so it gives everyone the equal opportunity to voice their ideas and opinions. However, there will always be the added complications of race, gender, nationality, income, etc. They are factors that affect one’s power which evidently affects the context that Joichi Ito refers to. Without  geographic boundaries, there is less variation in ideas which in my opinion is highly concerning and threatening to one’s freedom of speech. With the Internet dominated by a single viewpoint, the context defined by Ito, the distinction between chaos and order, and the understanding of “truth” will all be subjective.

    <p> Week 2 (World-Wide Web): </p>
    <p> “The World-Wide Web” is a very informative article that explains the functionality of how information is sent and received. It is interesting reading about the structure of WWW; it caters specifically to society’s current needs and wants. In another words, the web is in constant modification. The web started as a means of “tracking personal information on a distributed project” but it has developed greatly in just a few years. With society’s emphasis on efficiency, developers are exploring the possibility of containing more machine-oriented semantic information to allow information to be processed faster. Developers are also expanding web’s services to cater the public, such as commercial services or teleconferencing. Even the web’s interface has the potential to be greater (3D imaging).  
People have an innovative spirit when it comes to the web. The web is still fairly new; the possibilities are endless. And as stated by Donald Norman, “technology that prevail don't have to be the best ones— they just have to be good enough”. Like email, as long as there is a need, the tool will prevail and continue to improve.

        <p> Week 4 (UX Design): </p>
        <p>
The underlying point that each author makes is, the website is for the user, you are just the creator of the experience. And because the user should be given the belief that he/she has control, the website has to be a comfortable space for the user to interactive with. This includes giving the user satisfaction, relieving anxiety, and ensuring credibility. Motion is a key reinforcer of the user’s control. But despite easy to address, it is difficult to implement or master. Charles Mauro’s analysis of Angry Birds was quite insightful however, it never really clarified how to create good UI/UX. In another words, it mentioned the success of the game but the road to a game’s success is still in question. Mauro does state that “success is bound up in slowing down that which could be fast, erasing that which is easily renewable, and making visual that which is mysterious and memorable” but there are many exceptions to this claim.
The concept for my website redesign is branding me. My original website was organized and functional however by no means did it reflect me. Essentially, I want this website to eventually be my online portfolio so I want it to reflect my style and personality. Hence, the revised website is very structured but with the interactivity of the ball and buttons and the inclusion of circles and bright colors, the site still has a fun and engaging quality to it. Furthermore because my intended audience would be my professor, peers, and potential employers, I wanted to make the interface simple and easily navigable; the artwork should be the highlights of the website. The projects and reflections can easily be accessed by scrolling down. I hope to achieve schema formation, view artworks by scrolling up or down.

        <p> Week 8 (The Internet as Art by Goran Mijuk): </p>
        <p> Goran Mijuk’s argument is not only that Internet is an art form, rather it thrives on the collaboration of users. Like Montfort’s argument that code is not objective, Mijuk emphasizes that the Internet is a form of art. One of the artists that Mijuk highlights is Antoni Abad’s website that caters towards handicapped people traveling/living in Geneva and Barcelona. Granted it is a help group, but at the same time it highlights the non-accessibility of the city. It addresses a much bigger problem. His website reminds me of Robert Frank’s well known photograph: “Trolley— New Orleans”. Evidently it is just a photograph but at the same time it shows the racial segregation and hatred that was present in the 1950s. And if Frank’s photograph is art, who is to say that Abad’s website isn’t. Each artists uses his specific platform to prompt social action. And with the Internet as an art form, Mijuk argues that the users are both the artists and the consumers. The users are simultaneously informing and receiving information from the Internet. It is through this constant circulation that allows the Internet to thrive. For the Internet is an art that is driven by social connection and communication.  </p>

        <p> Week 9 (Design Research and Innovation/Critical Making): </p>
        <p> Don Norman is quite a character. I admire his bravery in making such strong claims against the design industry. I do not know if I completely agree with his argument however it does clarify some of my questions. In high school, I took an introduction to design that taught me the fundamentals of color, balance, shapes, etc. However to this day, I still feel like I am artistically paralyzed to create “good” design. It seems difficult if not impossible to be unique, which possibly proves Norman’s idea of the gap between research and practice. Despite my understanding of the color theory or symmetry, I am unable to put it into practice. For as Norman argues, there is no relationship between the knowledge gained and the design of the product. Rather Norman argues that what is perceived as good design is actually system thinking— catering everything towards projecting one image. For even though the value of Apple products have decreased considerably, it continues to be well known. For it has created an unforgettable image.
