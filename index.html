          Dorothy Peng from Palisades Park, New Jersey moved to Los Angeles after graduating and receiving her GED at Bergen County Academies, one of New Jersey’s top magnet high schools. From an early childhood, she explored and expressed her talents through music, drawing, dancing, singing, and acting. It gave her a foundation that encouraged her to explore the arts. In high school, she was enrolled as a Visual Arts major. During the summer of 2013 or her junior year in high school, she was admitted into the film and production division of Northwestern’s National High School Institute. During her time there, she made many connections not only with the faculty but future potential filmmakers as well. In her last year of high school, she worked for one year in New York City as an intern at CITYarts, a non-profit organization that promotes children to create public art. Then in the following year, she interned at Good TV, a TV station in Taiwan and Maximum Impact, a successful advertising firm in New York City. Through her internships, she obtained not only new skills but real-life experiences that gave her a new perspective of the media industry. Today, she continues to pursue her passion in the arts and media at the University of Southern California as a second year Media Arts and Practice major. In 2015, in hope of enlarging her skill set in technology, she declared a Mobile Application Development minor in the Viterbi School of Engineering. Her background in art and technology makes her a highly favorable prospect for employers. In the coming school year she also hopes to study abroad in Florence, Italy; an experience that will leave her inspired and determined. As an artist, she will never stop exploring, learning, or anticipating. She describes her life as an adventure of new opportunities. She is excited to see what the future will bring.
