		<p> Week 1 (Aesthetics of the Internet): </p>
		<p> In “Aesthetics of the Internet”, Joichi Ito argues that context equates to the interconnectedness of computer and people that the Internet provides. I think it is a very interesting argument, rather placing the worth or the value on the Internet or its users, its the interaction that seems to interest him. I also agree with such statement because even if the information is available and there are people that are educated, passionate, and actively engaged without the mesh of them together, no thought or action can be produced. With large amount of information being accessed and shared, communities continue to excel and grow. But at the same, the type of information shared could also be quite limiting. Since the Internet is still managed by people, the dominance of some ideas over others is inevitable. In most cases, the Internet is open source so it gives everyone the equal opportunity to voice their ideas and opinions. However, there will always be the added complications of race, gender, nationality, income, etc. They are factors that affect one’s power which evidently affects the context that Joichi Ito refers to. Without  geographic boundaries, there is less variation in ideas which in my opinion is highly concerning and threatening to one’s freedom of speech. With the Internet dominated by a single viewpoint, the context defined by Ito, the distinction between chaos and order, and the understanding of “truth” will all be subjective.

    <p> Week 2 (World-Wide Web): </p>
    <p> “The World-Wide Web” is a very informative article that explains the functionality of how information is sent and received. It is interesting reading about the structure of WWW; it caters specifically to society’s current needs and wants. In another words, the web is in constant modification. The web started as a means of “tracking personal information on a distributed project” but it has developed greatly in just a few years. With society’s emphasis on efficiency, developers are exploring the possibility of containing more machine-oriented semantic information to allow information to be processed faster. Developers are also expanding web’s services to cater the public, such as commercial services or teleconferencing. Even the web’s interface has the potential to be greater (3D imaging).  
People have an innovative spirit when it comes to the web. The web is still fairly new; the possibilities are endless. And as stated by Donald Norman, “technology that prevail don't have to be the best ones— they just have to be good enough”. Like email, as long as there is a need, the tool will prevail and continue to improve.
